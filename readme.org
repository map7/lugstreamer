* LUGStreamer

** What?

It streams our Linux User Group to the internet (currently via Youtube).

** Why?

We wanted a solution which has an external MIC and flexibility (local store, 
picture in picture) mixed with simplicity allowing us to hit a single button
to get the stream happening at our LUG.

** How?

Hook a Raspberry PI up with a camera, button, LED and use a bit of ffmpeg magic
to get it all together.

** Next

What's next
- Use the HDMI device to capture the personals stream to the TV and stream that.
  The device in question outputs MJPEG so that would need to be converted to work
  in youtube.
- Add Picture in Picture
- Lower the bandwidth
- Fix the latency in audio
